# Notes
## Working-on-ATM
- Reworking model.py, methods to implement:
[] Finish the _set_uv_grid method
## To-Do
[] Finish rework of model.py and implement tests
[] Make the model_components (formerly independent models) work with the new model standard and implement test
[] Create composite_model class (maybe its own file) and implement test
[] Make the composite model class output in a way that can be taken by the DataHandler class
[] Rework fourier.py and implement tests
[] Implement better tests for model.py
[] Rework the plotting functionality for the fitted models
[] Make fits adapt to the new scheme and maybe implement tests here as well
